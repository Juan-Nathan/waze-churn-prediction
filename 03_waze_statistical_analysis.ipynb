    "# Predicting Monthly User Churn for Waze\n",
    "\n",
    "This is an **advanced data analytics** project aimed at developing a machine learning model to predict **user churn**. Churn quantifies the number of users who have uninstalled the Waze app or stopped using the app. This project focuses on monthly user churn. An accurate model will help prevent churn, improve user retention, and grow Waze’s business.\n",
    "\n",
    "An accurate model can also help identify specific factors that contribute to churn and answer questions such as: \n",
    "- Who are the users most likely to churn?\n",
    "- Why do users churn? \n",
    "- When do users churn?\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, if Waze can identify a segment of users who are at high risk of churning, Waze can proactively engage these users with special offers to try and retain them. Otherwise, Waze may lose these users without knowing why. \n",
    "\n",
    "Ultimately, the insights generated will help Waze leadership optimize the company’s retention strategy, enhance user experience, and make data-driven decisions about product development.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is **Part 3** of the project."
