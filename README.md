# ðŸš— User Churn Prediction using Waze App Usage Data

This project applies advanced data analytics in Python to predict monthly **user churn** in the Waze application using a synthetic dataset designed to simulate real-world application usage. Churn measures the number of users who either uninstalled or stopped using the Waze app. 

An effective model will help determine which users are most likely to churn, why they churn, and when churn occurs.

These insights help Waze proactively engage at-risk users, optimize retention strategies, and make data-driven decisions to improve user experience and business growth.

| `driven_km_drives`         | Total kilometers driven during the month                                                            |
| `duration_minutes_drives`  | Total driving duration in minutes during the month                                                  |
| `activity_days`            | Number of days the user opened the app during the month                                             |
| `driving_days`             | Number of days the user drove (at least 1 km) during the month                                      |

 ## Project Structure
 1. **`01_waze_eda`**: Initial exploratory data analysis (EDA) to inspect the data and uncover usage patterns and churn trends.
 2. **`02_waze_further_eda_visualization`**: Further EDA with visualizations to gain a deeper understanding of the story that the data tells.
 3. **`03_waze_statistical_analysis`**: Statistical analysis (hypothesis testing and confidence intervals) to draw more insights from the data.
 4. **`04_waze_logistic_regression`**: Binomial logistic regression modeling.
 5. **`05_waze_tree_models`**: Tree-based modeling (random forest and XGBoost).

## Modeling Results

Two models delivered the best performance in predicting churn:

- **Logistic Regression**  
  - Built with feature engineering, Elastic Net regularization, and Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique (SMOTE) to address class imbalance.  
  - **Performance**: 74% recall and AUC of 0.70, effectively identifying likely churners while providing fair discriminative ability.
- **XGBoost**  
  - Developed with feature engineering and hyperparameter tuning via cross-validation.  
  - **Performance**: 83% recall and AUC of 0.69, excelling at capturing users at risk of churn while maintaining acceptable discriminative ability.
