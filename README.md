# ðŸš— User Churn Prediction from Waze App Usage Data

This project uses data analytics and machine learning in Python to predict monthly user churn in the Waze application. By analyzing app-usage patterns, the model identifies which users are most likely to leave, why they churn, and when churn is most likely to occur. These insights help Waze proactively engage at-risk users, optimize retention strategies, and make data-driven decisions to improve user experience and business growth. The project is based on a synthetic dataset created to simulate real-world application usage.

 ## Project Breakdown
 1. **`01_waze_eda`** : Initial exploratory data analysis (EDA) to inspect the data and uncover usage patterns and churn trends in it.
 2. **`02_waze_further_eda_visualization`**: Further EDA with visualizations to gain a deeper understanding of the story that the data tells.
 3. **`03_waze_statistical_analysis`**: Statistical analysis (hypothesis testing and confidence intervals) to draw more insights from the data.
 4. **`04_waze_logistic_regression`**: Binomial logistic regression modeling.
 5. **`05_waze_tree_models`**: Tree-based modeling (Random Forest and XGBoost).

## Modeling Results

Two models delivered the best performance in predicting churn:

- **Logistic Regression**  
  Built with feature engineering, Elastic Net regularization, and Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique (SMOTE) to address class imbalance.  
  **Performance**: 74% recall and AUC of 0.7, indicating decent discriminative ability while effectively capturing churned users.

- **XGBoost**  
  Developed with feature engineering and hyperparameter tuning via cross-validation.  
  **Performance**: 83% recall and AUC of 0.69, excelling at capturing churned users while maintaining acceptable discriminative ability.
